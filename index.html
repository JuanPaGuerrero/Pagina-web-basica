        <h3>Brief description of his bestseller book Rich father Poor father.</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>The story briefly recounts the life of a boy who faces the needs of a lower middle class family, this due to the financial decisions of his natural father.</li>
            <li>The relationship that occurs between this child and a classmate from his school radically changed his way of thinking about money since then, thanks to the father of his classmate, who in a certain way influenced ways of thinking very different from those that his natural father had taught him about money and how to manage it.</li>
        </ul>
